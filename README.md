Why?
====
This repository is inspired by [@mbektimirov](https://github.com/mbektimirov)'s question [Difference with Sigma.js](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph/issues/6). I am trying to list all known graph drawing libraries, and [inviting their authors](https://github.com/anvaka/graph-drawing-libraries/issues/1) to collaborate here.
